# LOGIN

This code is for a login page that I developed using Javascript.
In Entry.js file uses Node's express.js framework to implement a server. 
In the public folder you can find the js folder which contains the code for 
all Javascript files for my Webpages. I used express-handlebars 
for easy HTML templating.
